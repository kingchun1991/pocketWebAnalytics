# Testing Plan - Current Implementation

## Overview

Before starting the API refactoring, we need to test the current implementation to establish a baseline and identify any issues.

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup ✅

- [ ] PocketBase is running
- [ ] Environment variables are configured
- [ ] Next.js development server is running
- [ ] Database tables are created and accessible

### 2. PocketBase Connection Testing

- [ ] Admin authentication works
- [ ] Database collections are accessible
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations work
- [ ] Site creation and management

### 3. Current API Endpoint Testing (`/api/count/route.ts`)

- [ ] GET request handling
- [ ] POST request handling
- [ ] Bot detection functionality
- [ ] Geolocation tracking
- [ ] Language detection
- [ ] Basic hit recording in database

### 4. Client-Side Script Testing (`pocketWebAnalytics.js`)

- [ ] Script loads correctly
- [ ] Automatic page view tracking
- [ ] Event tracking functionality
- [ ] Bot filtering
- [ ] Query parameter handling

### 5. Data Flow Testing

- [ ] End-to-end tracking (script → API → database)
- [ ] Data accuracy verification
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Response time measurement

### 6. Database Schema Verification

- [ ] All tables exist
- [ ] Relationships are properly configured
- [ ] Indexes are created
- [ ] Sample data can be inserted

## Test Implementation

### Test Cases to Create:

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoint testing
3. **E2E Tests** - Full tracking workflow
4. **Performance Tests** - Response time and load testing
5. **Manual Tests** - Browser testing with actual tracking

### Tools Needed:

- Jest for unit testing
- Supertest for API testing
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Manual browser testing

## Expected Results

Document what should work vs. what actually works, then prioritize fixes before refactoring.
